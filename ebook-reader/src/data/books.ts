                content: `The night Nora Seed decided to die was unlike any other night. It was a cold, crisp evening in Bedford, and the streets were quiet as snowflakes began to fall.\n\nNora lived in an unremarkable apartment on the second floor of an unremarkable building on an unremarkable street. She had just lost her job at the music shop—String Theory—the very place she had once dreamed of owning.\n\nHer cat, Voltaire, had died earlier that week. Her brother barely spoke to her anymore. The wedding invitation from her former best friend had arrived that morning, a cruel reminder of all the connections she had let slip away.\n\nShe sat on her worn couch, staring at the wall, feeling the weight of every wrong decision she had ever made pressing down on her chest. Life, it seemed, was nothing but an endless sequence of regrets.\n\n"What's the point?" she whispered to the empty room.\n\nThe answer, when it came, would be stranger than anything she could have imagined.`

Books lined every wall, extending in all directions as far as she could see.\n\n"Hello, Nora," said a voice behind her.\n\nShe turned to find an elderly woman with kind eyes sitting behind a desk. Despite her age, there was something timeless about her—something that made Nora feel like she had known her forever.\n\n"Mrs. Elm?" Nora gasped. It was her school librarian, the one person who had always believed in her.\n\n"In a manner of speaking," Mrs. Elm smiled. "Welcome to the Midnight Library. Every book here represents a life you could have lived, if you had made different choices."\n\nNora looked around at the endless shelves, overwhelmed by the sheer number of possibilities.\n\n"You mean... I can live any of these lives?"\n\n"For a time," Mrs. Elm nodded. "Until you find the one that makes you want to stay. Or until you realize something important."\n\n"What's that?"\n\n"That's for you to discover."`

                content: `Mrs. Elm led Nora deeper into the library, past countless shelves filled with books of every color and size. Finally, they stopped at a large, heavy tome bound in dark green leather.\n\n"This," Mrs. Elm said, placing her hand gently on the cover, "is your Book of Regrets. Every regret you've ever had is written here."\n\nNora felt a chill run down her spine. "I don't want to read that."\n\n"You don't have to read all of it. But to find the lives you might want to explore, you need to understand what you regret. What roads you didn't take."\n\nWith trembling hands, Nora opened the book. The pages were filled with her own handwriting, though she didn't remember writing any of it.\n\n*I regret not marrying Dan.*\n*I regret giving up swimming.*\n*I regret not going to Australia with my brother.*\n*I regret not keeping in touch with Izzy.*\n*I regret...*\n\nThe list went on and on. It was painful to see her regrets laid out so starkly, but it was also, somehow, clarifying.\n\n"Each of these regrets," Mrs. Elm explained, "corresponds to a life where you made a different choice. Would you like to try one?"`

I try to move but my body doesn't respond right away.\n\nOkay. Let's start with the basics. What do I know?\n\nI'm a human. That's good. I'm pretty sure about that one. And I'm... somewhere. A room of some kind. The walls are white. Or maybe cream colored. It's hard to tell with this bright light in my eyes.\n\nI try to lift my hand to shade my eyes, and after a few attempts, it works. My arm feels like it weighs a thousand pounds, but it moves.\n\nI see my hand. Normal looking hand. Five fingers. Good. That seems right.\n\nSlowly, more of my surroundings come into focus. I'm in some kind of medical bay. There are machines around me, beeping softly. I'm connected to IVs and monitors.\n\nAnd I'm not alone.\n\nThere are two other beds in the room, and in each one lies a body. They're not moving. They look... dead.\n\nI should probably be more alarmed by this, but I'm still too groggy to process it properly.\n\nWhat happened here?`

I remember the Petrova problem—the strange organisms consuming the sun's energy, threatening to cool our planet into an ice age. I remember the Hail Mary project.\n\nThis is the Hail Mary. I'm on a spaceship.\n\nAnd apparently, I'm the only one left alive.\n\nI force myself to sit up, which takes considerable effort. My muscles have atrophied. How long have I been asleep? The computer next to my bed gives me the answer: years. I've been in a coma for years as this ship traveled through space.\n\nThe mission comes flooding back to me. We were sent to Tau Ceti—a star that inexplicably wasn't being affected by the Petrova organisms. We were supposed to find out why and bring that information back to Earth.\n\nBut the other crew members are dead. Their beds are right there, and they didn't make it.\n\nIt's just me. The fate of humanity rests on my shoulders alone.\n\nNo pressure.`

I was designed to be a companion for a child, to provide emotional support and learning assistance. Rosa was my friend in those days, another AF with whom I would stand and watch the world go by.\n\n"Klara," Rosa said to me one morning, "do you see how the Sun moves across the sky?"\n\nI had noticed this, of course. The Sun's patterns were among the first things I learned to observe. The way its light changed throughout the day, the shadows it cast, the warmth it brought through the window.\n\n"I see it," I said. "The Sun is very kind to us. It gives us nourishment."\n\nThis was true. We AFs needed sunlight to function properly. But I felt something beyond mere functionality. I felt... gratitude. Perhaps even love.\n\nThe Manager came by then, adjusting our positions slightly. "Looking good, girls," she said. "Maybe today will be the day one of you finds a home."\n\nA home. That was what we all waited for—to be chosen by a child, to become their friend.`
